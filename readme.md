# Breakout Enhanced

## How to Play

- **Move the Paddle:** Use the arrow keys (or A/D keys) to move your paddle horizontally.
- **Hit the Ball:** Launch the ball to break bricks. Each brick you destroy adds points to your score.
- **Watch Your Lives:** If you miss the ball, you lose a life. When all lives are lost, a game over screen appears and the game resets.
- **Level Progression:** Clear all bricks in a level to automatically advance to the next level without losing your current score.

## Features

- **Persistent Score:** Your score accumulates as you destroy bricks and carries over between levels.
- **Lives & Game Over Screen:** A dynamic lives counter updates each time you miss the ball. When you run out of lives, the game shows a game over screen before returning to the main menu.
- **Explosion Particle Effects:** Enjoy visual feedback with an explosion particle effect every time a brick is destroyed.
- **Smooth Scene Transitions:** Animated scene transitions using DOTween provide a polished feel.
- **Enhanced Game Feel:** Additional touches like camera shake and integrated sound effects improve the overall gameplay experience.
